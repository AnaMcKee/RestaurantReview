# Restaurant Reviews

## Description
Restaurant Reviews App is part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree. The app shows users a list of restaurants in their area, filtered by neighborhoods and various cuisines. It also shows geographic location and customer's reviews.
A starting code was given by UDACITY. The project has been converted from static to a mobile-ready web application with accessibility. Images were optimized to give the app a faster loading. In order to create an offline experience for users, a service worker was added to the project.

## Instructions

- Run the project locally by starting up a HTTP server. You can use Python for this purpose. Install it if it's not already installed in your computer. For Python 3.x, type: python -m http.server 8000 in the terminal where the root of the project is located. 
- Once the server is running, visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
